## Usage

To create a React app, use [degit](https://github.com/tiged/tiged)

```
mkdir your-app-name
cd your-app-name
npx degit criesbeck/react-vitest
npm install
```

## Test

Test that the initial app works by executing

```
npm start
```

and opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

Test that the unit tests are working by executing

```
npm test
```

Two tests should run and pass. 

## Git

If everything is working, set up [your local and remote repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git).
